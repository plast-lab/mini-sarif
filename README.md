A Java library to serialize static analysis results using the [SARIF
format](https://rawgit.com/sarif-standard/sarif-spec/master/Static%20Analysis%20Results%20Interchange%20Format%20(SARIF).html).

This library does not support the full SARIF specification but aims to
offer support for displaying simple analysis results.

Tested with GitHub ("codeql-action/upload-sarif" Action) and Visual
Studio Code (with the SARIF viewer plugin).
